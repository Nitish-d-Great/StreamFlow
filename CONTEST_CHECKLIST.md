# Yellow Network Prize - Contest Checklist

## Current Status: ⚠️ Partially Ready

### ✅ What's Working:
1. **Complete dApp** - Landing page, video player, payment flow, confirmation page
2. **Nitrolite SDK Integrated** - `@erc7824/nitrolite` installed and configured
3. **Pay-per-second billing** - Real-time counter showing 0.0001 ETH/second
4. **MetaMask Integration** - Wallet connection functional
5. **Documentation** - README, QUICKSTART, NITROLITE_INTEGRATION guides
6. **Fallback Mechanism** - Graceful fallback to standard transactions

### ❌ What's Missing:

## CRITICAL: Contract Addresses Required

The **most important missing piece** is the Nitrolite contract addresses. Without these, the app cannot demonstrate Yellow Network's off-chain capabilities.

### How to Get Contract Addresses:

1. **Check Nitrolite GitHub Examples**
   - Visit: https://github.com/Layer3-Foundation/nitrolite
   - Look for examples or deployment scripts
   - Check for testnet contract addresses

2. **Contact Nitrolite Team**
   - Discord: Join the ERC-7824 community
   - Telegram: Check Yellow Network channels
   - Ask for Sepolia testnet contract addresses

3. **Use Example Configuration**
   - Look for example files in the Nitrolite SDK
   - Check if there's a `config.example.ts` or similar

### Required Contract Addresses:
```javascript
// Update src/services/nitrolite.js with these:
addresses: {
  custody: '0x...',        // NEED THIS
  adjudicator: '0x...',    // NEED THIS
  guestAddress: creatorAddress, // Dynamic
  tokenAddress: '0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000' // ETH
}
```

## Actions Needed to Complete Requirements:

### 1. **Get Contract Addresses** ⚠️ CRITICAL
- [ ] Visit Nitrolite GitHub
- [ ] Check for example configurations
- [ ] Contact Nitrolite team via Discord/Telegram
- [ ] Update `src/services/nitrolite.js` with addresses
- [ ] Test Nitrolite integration

### 2. **Test Yellow Network Features**
- [ ] Verify off-chain state channel creation
- [ ] Test instant payment finality
- [ ] Confirm lower gas fees
- [ ] Document Yellow Network benefits

### 3. **Create Demo Video** (2-3 minutes)
- [ ] Show landing page and wallet connection
- [ ] Demonstrate video playback with billing counter
- [ ] Show payment process via Yellow Network
- [ ] Highlight instant finality and low fees
- [ ] Explain off-chain transaction logic

### 4. **Submit to ETHGlobal**
- [ ] Upload project to GitHub
- [ ] Submit under "Yellow Network" prize track
- [ ] Include repo link
- [ ] Submit demo video

## How to Verify Yellow Network Integration:

### In Browser Console:
Look for these messages:
- ✅ `"Nitrolite is available for payments"` = Yellow Network working
- ❌ `"Nitrolite not available"` = Using fallback

### On Payment Page:
Check debug info showing:
- ✅ Nitrolite Status: Available
- ✅ Payment Method: State Channels

### Transaction Hash:
- Off-chain payments will show instant finality
- On-chain payments show standard blockchain confirmation time

## Judging Criteria Coverage:

### ✅ Problem & Solution: STRONG
- Addresses micro-payment problem in streaming
- Creative pay-per-second model

### ⚠️ Yellow SDK Integration: DEPTH YES, IMPACT PENDING
- ✅ Deep integration in code
- ❌ Cannot demonstrate impact without contract addresses

### ✅ Business Model: STRONG
- Clear pay-per-second revenue model
- Tied to efficient payment mechanism

### ⚠️ Presentation: GOOD DOCS, NEEDS DEMO VIDEO
- ✅ Excellent written documentation
- ❌ Need to create demo video

### ✅ Team Potential: YOU DEMONSTRATE THIS

## Next Steps Priority:

1. **IMMEDIATE**: Get Nitrolite contract addresses
2. **HIGH**: Update contract addresses in code
3. **HIGH**: Test full Yellow Network integration
4. **MEDIUM**: Create demo video
5. **MEDIUM**: Submit to ETHGlobal

## Resources:

- Nitrolite GitHub: https://github.com/Layer3-Foundation/nitrolite
- ERC-7824 Docs: https://erc7824.org/
- Yellow Network: https://yellow.org/
- Yellow Docs: https://docs.yellow.org/

## Summary:

Your project has **excellent code foundation** and **comprehensive documentation**. The **critical missing piece** is the Nitrolite contract addresses. Once you have those, the integration will work and you'll meet all technical requirements.

**Priority**: Focus on getting the contract addresses from the Nitrolite team/GitHub immediately!
